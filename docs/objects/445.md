#### Description:
  445 is a spiraled golden amulet with a small golden bead in the middle. It appears to be hollow, and a faint ticking sound can be heard inside. On the back of the amulet is  the inscription: “To Heather, remember your mother; love, Silver”.





#### Retrieval Information:
  A family picked Object-445 at a yard sale in [Redacted], Alaska, as a birthday gift for their 14 year old daughter.  The girl happened to be on suicide watch at that time. She   wore OBJ-445 at all times because she loved it very much. After two attempted suicides, the object was found to have its special properties. Sector “Para” then showed up and     retrieved the item, and silenced the local news stations.

#### Usage:
  When worn, its wearer cannot be harmed through any external means.
  The amulet does not seem to affect the wearer’s health, but manipulates the surrounding world to make sure the wearer cannot be harmed.
  Only works on humans as tests have shown thus far.

### Tests:

#### Controlled Test | #112 | “Gunpoint”
##### Subject: Due-Payer
##### Test:
Injure Subject with handgun.
#### Result:
Gun ceased to fire when pointed toward the Subject.
Same result when the bullet was attempted to be ricocheted from an object.
Gun fired normally otherwise.

#### Controlled Test | #116 | “Nail”
##### Subject: Due-Payer
##### Test:
Step on a rusty nail.
#### Result:
Subject approached a board with a nail sticking up from the middle.
Subject then tried to step on the nail, but it snapped.  Multiple attempts were made with the same result.

#### Controlled Test | #127 | “Self Harm”
##### Subject: Due-Payer
##### Test:
Subject is instructed to ram themselves into the wall as hard as they can.
#### Result:
Subject stood about 15’ away from a concrete wall and charged at it.
The subject seemed to move slower and slower and seemed to fall asleep right before reaching the wall.  Other DP-Class Subjects participated in the same test, with the same result.

#### Variable Test | #448 | “Fall”
##### Subject: DP-Class
##### Test:
Drop out of an airplane without any support.
#### Result:
Subject was monitored from the ground, drones, and radar.
Subject dropped; 5 seconds before hitting the ground, all drone cameras ceased to work, subject disappeared from radar, and all spectators went blind. Subject then appeared on the ground, unconscious. Subject could not seem to recall the drop at all.

#### Controlled Test | #578 | “Crush”
##### Subject: DP-Class
##### Test:
Crush Subject in a “crusher room” (the walls of the room close in from the sides crushing anything inside)
#### Results:
Subject was placed in the crusher and the walls started to close. The power then shut off, stopping the movement of the walls.  When the power was finally restored, the walls continued to close. When Subject was nearly crushed, a loud “snap” was heard from where the pistons were pushing the walls. The walls then stopped moving. It was later figured out that a bolt had come loose and fell out of the piston, letting the hydraulic fluid leak out.
