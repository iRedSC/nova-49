### WARNING:  THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND DANGEROUS OBJECT,  AND MUST BE HANDLED WITH EXTREME CAUTION!  IN THE PAST 15 YEARS WE HAVE HAD OVER 12,000 CASUALTIES! FOR THIS REASON A LOT OF THIS DOCUMENT WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE FOR CLASS XV N-49 PERSONELLE.

#### Description:
In [Redacted], a house resides in the countryside.  Hidden in plain sight, with nothing peculiar on the surface, it has remained undetected for centuries.

#### Floors:
##### LVL-1 | The Displays

Unpainted Cinder Blocks form the walls of this level. A short, tan carpet covers the whole area.  The entire level is split into many small rooms, each of which hold a podium with some kind of paranormal object, as well as a detailed description of how they work.  Attempting to steal one of these objects will cause a heavy metal door to slam closed in the doorway of that podium’s room.  The room will then fill with some sort of gas through vents at the top of the room.  Video footage from a camera that one of the researchers had while attempting to steal one of these objects shows that he was either dead or unconscious, was dragged into the elevator by some dark creature, and then plummeted down at extremely high speeds into the dark abyss, at which some point the video cut out.  Dr. Bronze seems to be completely unaffected by the gas as video evidence suggests.

##### Floor-2 | Research Lab

##### Floor-3 | Warp Engine

A giant metal cylinder fills the center of this level, Dr. Bronze has referred to it as the “Warp Engine”, but will not discuss what it is used for. Top N-49 researchers figure it has something to do with the fact that it is impossible to dig into the side of the house, because tunnels will always curve around the house, but always look perfectly straight to anyone in the tunnel.



##### Floor-5 / Floor-10 | Unknown

Dr. Bronze Refuses to stop at these floors.

##### Floor-11 | The Maze

At this level Dr. Bronze refuses to exit the elevator, and will wait for anyone who exits to look around.  But most of the people to look around don’t come back, due to the odd nature of this level.  It’s a maze, dimly lit with a dark blue wallpaper, concrete floors, and water dripping from the ceiling.  The maze goes on forever, so venturing too far will prompt you to get lost. Researchers have been able to video the whole time they were in it, but never able to get out.

##### Floor-12 | Broken Cages

Floor-12's walls and floor are made of concrete, as well as the cealing. This floor has only one large room, which is filled with 16 giant cages, all of which look like they have been ripped apart by some sort of giant creature.

##### Floor-13 | Iron Cows

The largest room up to this point (With the exeption of Floor-11), Floor-13 seems be over 60' high, and over 500 square feet of floor. There are piles of 5' 8' 3' iron cows filling the corners of the room which seem to be rusting heavily; there are also a few extremely polished cows set up in the middle of the room.
