*Detective Derious, an X level agent, is wandering down the empty streets of LA in the dead of night while playing with a switchblade.*\
Derious understood exactly why he was sent on this case- he wasn't a normal human; but that never bothered him, after all, he basically had super powers...\
*He walks into a bar, scanning the room as if looking for someone particular.*
> ah, there he is!

*A very well dressed man walks up to greet Derious*

> Derious, just the man I was looking for!\
> I'm agent Cason, I personally requested your visit.\
> listen, I've been investigating this subject for the past few months, and we're dealing with something much bigger than I first thought.

> Show me what you got so far Cas..

> Certainly!\
> It seems the subject is able to create symbols that can be anything up to lethal..\
> I was hoping you would be able to actually take a look at these symbols, due to your- speciality..

*Derious walks over to the bar and orders a drink*

> Alright Cas, we'll start in the morning.
